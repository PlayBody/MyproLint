    Procedure:  _adetool.i
                                       
    Purpose:    Defines an internal procedure called 'ADEPersistent'. This
                should be included in any Persistent procedure which you do
                not want to be automatically deleted by any ADE tools (e.g.
                Editor, UIB). The program _runtool.p will check for the
                existence of ADEPersistent in a procedure and will delete
                it only if it doesn't exist.

    Syntax :    {adecomm/_adetool.i}

    Parameters: None
