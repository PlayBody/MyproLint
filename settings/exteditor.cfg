only the first two lines are used by Prolint. All other lines,
including this one, are just comments.
This file contains the shell commands used by Prolint for opening 
a sourcefile in a text editor. The first line is typically the command, the 
second line typically contains command-line arguments for the command.
  &1  is replaced by the name of the sourcefile to open
  &2  is replaced by the line number to put the cursor on
                                                         
Example configurations for various editors: copy the two lines for the 
editor of your choice to the top of this file (so they are lines 1 and 2).
Remember, if a filename contains spaces it is probably required to put that 
filename between quotes.
