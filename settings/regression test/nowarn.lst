# this file specifies which particular warnings should be suppressed. The rules will
# still be executed, but warnings are intercepted if they match this file.
# 
# format:
#    sourcefile|rule|linenumbers
#    sourcefile|_file-size|size
#
# sourcefile : spell exactly as it appears in "Prolint result window"
# rule       : identfier of the rule that gives the warning
# linenumbers: comma separated list of linenumbers where the warning should be suppressed
#
# size : the filesize of the sourcefile, in bytes
# if _file-size is not specified, or if size doesn't match the actual size of the sourcefile,
# all lines for sourcefile will be invalid. So after you edit a sourcefile no warnings will be suppressed.
#
# empty lines or lines matching #* are ignored
