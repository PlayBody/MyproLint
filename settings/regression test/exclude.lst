# this file specifies which particular warnings should be excluded. The rules will
# still be executed, but warnings are intercepted if they match this file.
# You can also consider using {&_proparse_ prolint-nowarn(ruleid,ruleid)} directives
# 
# format:
#    sourcefile|rules
#
# sourcefile : spell exactly as it appears in "Prolint result window", wildcards are accepted. CAN-DO rules apply
# rule       : comma separated list of identifiers of the rules that gives the warning, 
#              wildcards are accepted. CAN-DO rules apply
#
# empty lines or lines matching #* are ignored


# just for fun: ignore everything from ifindent.i except ifindent1 and ifindent2
prolint/regrtest/ifindent.i|!ifindent*,*

# ignore CVS backups of 'work in progress' files:
prolint/*CVS/*|*
